Features:
- Fabfile for fully automated Django project installation and deploy process on an Ubuntu 10.4 server
- Stack: nginx, Apache, Django, PostgreSQL, memcached, Postfix
- Everything runs on a single server
- Cooperates with siblings -- run multiple of these on the same server

Non-features:
- Sites running across multiple servers (e.g., a separate database server, or multiple web servers. This isn't hard to add to the fabfile, but I didn't want to release untested code.
- Servers running sites other than those on this exact setup. The Fabfile overwrites nginx settings etc.
- Accepting inbound mail
- Configuration tuned for high traffic. Set your own values in the `server` directory's various config files.
- Running on servers other than Ubuntu 10.4

Caveats:
- Written for Fabric <1.0, haven't updated it yet
- I haven't tried running this from Windows
